          I am a little, techy, music lady currently based in London, UK. I’m currently working as a freelance producer, composer, musician and vocalist. I’m passionate about electronic music, and particularly interested in the boundary that lies between live/acoustic performance and electronic sound. I love many aspects of the music making process and over the years have developed a wide set of skills both in the studio and on the stage. I work mostly from my home studio using Logic Pro & Ableton but still have a big love for Cubase which I learned my craft on. I am a professionally trained musician, I majored in composition at Leeds College of Music (1st) and am a grade 8 classical pianist and vocalist.  My sound as an artist/songwriter is soulful, cinematic and electronic but I’ve also composed in a number of styles including acoustic, folk, pop, RnB, hip-hop, eastern fusion, jazz, cinematic, orchestral, vocal, drum and bass, house & calypso. I design loop packs for a number of sample pack companies, and currently create ongoing bespoke sound packs for Novation’s apps Launchpad & Blocs Wave for iOS. On going I also compose/produce music to brief for BMG Chrysalis. As an artist I’ve released on independent labels and gigged a lot around the UK and festival scene. A number of my tracks have received national radio play and have been used for sync on television shows, adverts and corporate videos. As a producer I’ve produced and mixed for a number of different independent artists and bands.

          <BR><BR><a data-toggle="pill" href="#contact" class="call-meh">Get in touch</a> if you like my style and would like to get me involved in a project - I’m available for production, mixing, songwriting, composing, singing, recording & playing live. I’m particularly excited by new technologies and hardware but up for anything unique and interesting that I can vibe to.
